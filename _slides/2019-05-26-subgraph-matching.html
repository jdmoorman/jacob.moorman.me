## Subgraph Matching Problem

Find all copies of a **template** graph in a **world** graph

<img class="plain" src="definitions-example.png" width="50%">

An instance of the *template* in the *world* is called a **signal**

## Three main approaches

* Tree Search
* Constraint Propagation
* Graph Indexing

## Tree Search

  1. Find all signals where \\(\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{1}\\)
    1. Find all signals where \\(\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{1}\\) and \\(\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{6}\\)
      1. ...
  2. Find all signals where \\(\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{4}\\)
  3. ...

## Tree Search

* In what order should we match the template nodes?
* To which world nodes should we try matching them?

## Constraint Propagation

**To which world nodes should we try matching them?**

Try matching template nodes to world nodes which fulfill a subset of the subgraph isomorphism constraints.
