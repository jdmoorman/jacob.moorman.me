A tutorial from GitHub

## Create a Repository

1. In the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click + and then select New repository.
2. Name your repository `hello-world`.
3. Write a short description.
4. Select **Initialize this repository with a README**.

-vertical-

## Create a Branch

1. Go to your new repository `hello-world`.
2. Click the drop down that says **branch: master**.
3. Type a branch name, `readme-edits`, into the box.
4. Select the blue **Create branch** box.

<img src="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/readme-edits.gif" width="35%">




-vertical-

Now you have two branches,

`master` and `readme-edits`.

They look exactly the same, but not for long!




-vertical-

## The branch lifecycle

-vertical-

## Make and Commit Changes

1. Click the `README.md` file
2. Click the  pencil icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit.
3. In the editor, write a bit about yourself.
4. Write a commit message that describes your changes.
5. Click Commit changes button.




-vertical-

These changes will be made to just the `README` file on your `readme-edits` branch, so now this branch contains content that’s different from `master`.




-vertical-

## Open a Pull Request

1. Click the **Pull Request** tab, then from the Pull Request page, click the green **New pull request** button.
2. In the **Example Comparisons** box, select the branch you made, `readme-edits`, to compare with `master` (the original).
3. Look over your changes in the diffs on the Compare page, make sure they’re what you want to submit.
4. When you’re satisfied that these are the changes you want to submit, click the big green Create Pull Request button.
5. Give your pull request a title and write a brief description of your changes.




-vertical-

## Merge your Pull Request

1. Click the green Merge pull request button to merge the changes into master.
2. Click Confirm merge.
3. Go ahead and delete the branch, since its changes have been incorporated, with the Delete branch button in the purple box.
