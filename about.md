I am a fourth-year PhD student in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.ucla.edu/) at UCLA, where I work with [Andrea Bertozzi](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~bertozzi/) and [Deanna Needell](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~deanna/). I graduated from NJIT in 2016 with BS degrees in [Mathematical Science](https://math.njit.edu/) and [Computer Science](https://cs.njit.edu/).

In my spare time, I enjoy climbing.
