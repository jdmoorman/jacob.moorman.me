In June 2020, I will graduate from UCLA with a PhD in Mathematics.
I was advised by [Andrea Bertozzi](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~bertozzi/) and [Deanna Needell](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~deanna/) during my studies.
I graduated from NJIT in 2016 with BS degrees in Mathematical Science and Computer Science.
