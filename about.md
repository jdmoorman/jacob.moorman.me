I am a third-year PhD student in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.ucla.edu/) at UCLA, where I develop algorithms for subgraph matching and analyze randomized iterative methods for solving linear systems. I graduated from NJIT in 2016 with BS degrees in [Mathematical Science](https://math.njit.edu/) and [Computer Science](https://cs.njit.edu/). 

In my spare time, I enjoy rock climbing. If you're a climber in the LA area, get in touch. Let's climb together!
